## Installation

Clone the project with the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/doominating/Proffy.git
```

Then, get in the project dir and install the dependencies for each environment (backend, frontend and mobile):

```sh
cd Proffy/backend
npm install

cd Proffy/frontend
npm install

cd Proffy/mobile
npm install
```

Finally, you can start the applications (backend/frontend/mobile) with:

```sh
npm start
```

If you are in development environment, you can use the development server for backend (that runs nodemon for watches files modification and automatic re-start server):

```sh
npm dev
```

## Roadmap

- (**DONE**) Creates backend project;
- (**DONE**) Creates frontend project;
- (**IN PROGRESS**) Creates mobile project;
- (**IN PROGRESS**) Implements advanced features;
- Refactoring to improve the code readability;
